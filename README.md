# Awesome Project

The purpose of this repository is mostly to understand how the implicit implementation of interfaces in Go works, and how this can be used for unit testing in which dependencies are mocked.

It also shows how simple a Go program can look like, especially for engineers that come from a C#/Java or other object oriented languages background.

Although Go has OO capabilities as well (there's no concept of `class` but objects, composition and encapsulation are present), Go is defined by many people smarter than me as a `Data Oriented language`, and I completely agree with that.
